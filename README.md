# Malaria-Cells-Detection
A convolutional netrual network model to classify different stages of malaria cells. 

This project consists in using a Convolutional Netrual Network (CNN) to classify blood cells into different categories: "red blood cell", "difficult", "gametocyte", "trophozoite",
"ring", "schizont", "leukocyte". Apart from the Ô¨Årst type, the rest of the cells indicate some stage of malaria infection.

# Goal
The goal is to use a Neural Network to tell all the types of cells that are present in each image, that
is, this is a Multi-Label classification problem.

If a model can successfully identify these types of cells from images taken with a microscope, 
this would allow to automate a very time-consuming testing process, leaving human doctors with more time to 
treat the actual disease. Furthermore, an early malaria detection can save lives!
